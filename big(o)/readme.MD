# Big O Notation

## What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument approaches infinity. In computer science, Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

## Why is Big O Notation Important?

Big O notation is important because it helps us analyze the efficiency of algorithms and compare them based on their performance characteristics. By understanding the Big O complexity of an algorithm, we can make informed decisions about which algorithm to use in a given situation.

## Common Big O Notations

- **O(1)**: Constant time complexity. The running time of the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity. The running time of the algorithm grows logarithmically as the input size grows.
- **O(n)**: Linear time complexity. The running time of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time complexity. The running time of the algorithm grows in proportion to n log n of the input size.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity. The running time of the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the input.
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time complexity. The running time of the algorithm grows exponentially with the size of the input.

## Example

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

The time complexity of the `linear_search` function is O(n) because the number of iterations in the loop is directly proportional to the size of the input array `arr`.
